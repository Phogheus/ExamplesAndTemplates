# Examples and Templates

During my time as a software developer, I've written a lot of interesting pieces of code that solve very broad or very
specific problems. I also end up writing a lot of code I've written before, over and over. So, I decided to start a repository
of some basic content I'd like to not have to rewrite. If it helps someone, even better!

### Examples.gRPC

### Examples.gRPC.Client

### Examples.gRPC.Web

This project illustrates a basic gRPC web service responding to calls from Examples.gRPC.Client.

### Examples.ServiceBus

The project shows how to setup a basic consumer/producer for an Azure Service Bus resource.
